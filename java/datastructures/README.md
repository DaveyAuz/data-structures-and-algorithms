### Challenge 01


### Challenge 08 linked-list-zip
Write a function called zip lists
Arguments: 2 linked lists
Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

>This code is implementing a function called zipLists that takes in two lists of integers as arguments, and returns a new list that is a combination of the two input lists. The new list should alternate between
elements of the two input lists. The function is implemented using a zipLists class, which is instantiated with the two input lists.

>The code also includes a test function called test_zipLists that tests various input cases for the zipLists function. These tests include cases where the two input lists have different lengths, where one or both lists are empty, and where the input lists contain both positive and negative integers. The test function uses the assertEquals function to compare the expected output of the zipLists function with the actual output.
